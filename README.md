### Original vs Tampered Image Detection

ðŸš€ Welcome to the Original vs Tampered Image Detection repository! This project aims to detect whether an image is original or tampered using deep learning techniques.


## Original Image
An "Original Image" refers to an unaltered and authentic photograph. These images serve as the baseline for the model to learn and distinguish between authentic content and tampered or manipulated versions.

## Tampered Image
Tampered images within the dataset may exhibit various modifications, such as digital retouching, cloning, or other forms of visual alterations. The goal is to teach the model to recognize deviations from the authentic features learned during training on original images.

## ðŸ”® Predicting the Image

### Original ðŸ‘‡
In this example, the model confidently predicts the image as "Original." The intact and unaltered features captured in the photograph align with the characteristics learned from a diverse set of original images during training. The vibrant colors, natural composition, and lack of discernible tampering contribute to the model's accurate classification.
